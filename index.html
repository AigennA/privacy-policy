<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: February 27, 2026</p>

<p>
  This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Daily Affirmations – Mood Booster</strong>
  ("the App"), developed by <strong>Mopilappar</strong>, handles your information.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
  The App does <strong>not collect any personal information</strong>. We do not ask for
  your name, email address, phone number, or any other identifying information.
</p>
<p>
  All data created within the App (such as your mood entries, streak progress,
  favorite affirmations, and custom affirmations) is stored <strong>locally on your
  device only</strong> using Android's built-in storage. This data never leaves your device
  and is never transmitted to any server.
</p>

<h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
  The App uses the following third-party services:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Expo (expo.dev)</strong> – The App is built with the Expo framework.
    Expo may collect anonymous crash reports and usage statistics to improve the
    framework. See <a href="https://expo.dev/privacy" target="_blank">Expo Privacy Policy</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Google AdMob</strong> – The App may display advertisements provided by
    Google AdMob. AdMob may collect device identifiers and usage data to serve
    personalized or non-personalized ads. See
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
    You can opt out of personalized ads in your device settings under
    <em>Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization</em>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The App does <strong>not</strong> use Google Analytics or Facebook SDK.
</p>

<h2>3. Notifications</h2>
<p>
  If you choose to enable daily reminder notifications, the App will request
  permission to send you notifications. Notification preferences are stored
  locally on your device. You can disable notifications at any time in the
  App settings or in your device settings.
</p>

<h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
  The App does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13.
  Since no personal information is collected at all, the App is safe for all age groups.
</p>

<h2>5. Data Security</h2>
<p>
  Since all data is stored locally on your device, your data security depends on
  your device's security settings. We recommend using a screen lock on your device.
</p>

<h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
  We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted
  on this page with an updated date. Continued use of the App after changes
  constitutes your acceptance of the new policy.
